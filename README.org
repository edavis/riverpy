* riverpy

riverpy is a River of News aggregator written in Python.

It takes a subscription list full of RSS feeds and generates one or
more river.js files.

** Wha?

A River of News aggregator is a RSS reader that displays feed updates
in reverse chronological order (i.e., most recent entry first).

You can see one in action [[http://river.davising.com/index.html][here]].

** Installation

=$ pip install riverpy # eventually=

** Subscription Lists

riverpy accepts subscription lists as either OPML or YAML.

If you don't have a preference, I'd recommend YAML.

** Running
** Options
** Differences from the spec

Can output JSON rather than JSONP

** TODO
- Accept plain text subscription lists
- Add option to spit out --json or --jsonp
- Add option to write to local file
- web: use permalinks
- add license
- use logging instead of print
