riverpy is a [[http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/anotherPitchForRiverOfNews][River of News]] aggregator for the modern web.

Given an [[http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html][OPML file]] containing a [[http://opml.davising.com/rss.opml][list of RSS feeds organized by topic]],
riverpy generates a [[http://riverjs.org/][river.js]] file for each topic. Each river.js file
contains the chronological flow of information from the provided
feeds.

Here's an [[http://river.davising.com/rivers/news.js][example]] with some news feeds. When hooked up to a [[http://river.davising.com/index.html][web frontend]],
you can see it's a new take on what an RSS reader can be.
